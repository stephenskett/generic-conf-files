# Personal Generic Repo Config Files

A set of generic config files which could reasonably be used across a wide range of simple project repos - at least, as an initial starting point to be finessed depending on project specifics.

## Disclaimer

These generic conf files are intended primarily for my own use and may not be suitable for your projects.
They may also be adjusted over time in seemingly arbitrary ways as/when my dev practice changes!
